Hi, my name is Kyle McIlveen. I grew up in Grafton and first found my passion for athletics at the Grafton Athletics Club when I was just 8 years old. Competing in high jump, I went on to represent at the Australian National Junior Track and Field Championships. My coaching journey began over 10 years ago under the mentorship of Michele Hurcum, focusing on high jump, and has since grown into a career where Iâ€™ve had the privilege of coaching athletes from Little Athletics right through to international level.

Alongside athletics, I bring experience as both a coach and former state-level hockey player, which has given me a broad understanding of sport, performance, and athlete development. Now a Level 3 Jumps specific coach, I am passionate about helping athletes of all ages and abilities reach their potential while fostering a love for the sport.
