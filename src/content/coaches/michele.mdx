Michele’s high jump journey began as an athlete with the Northern Suburbs Club in Sydney, where the event quickly became her specialty. After moving to the North Coast, she discovered there were no coaches in her events and very little competition, until a workmate encouraged her to visit the local Little Athletics club. Seeing the natural talent of the young athletes sparked an idea: perhaps she could help them in the event she knew best, high jump, Michele began coaching — and never stopped.

Over the past 40 years, she has worked mostly with athletes aged 8 to 18, many of whom have gone on to national success. Her coaching has produced more than 60 national medalists, including Keith Elliott, who represented Australia at the 1999 World Youth Championships, and Alex Harrison, who narrowly missed World Junior selection in 2021 and went on to place 6th at the World University Games.

Michele believes the North Coast holds a wealth of untapped talent, and she’s as passionate as ever about helping the next “Keith” or “Alex” discover how high they can soar.
